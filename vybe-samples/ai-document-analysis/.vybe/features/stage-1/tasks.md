# Implementation Tasks - Stage 1: Basic Document Analysis

## Overview
This document breaks down Stage 1 implementation into specific, actionable coding tasks. Each task is designed to be completable in 1-2 hours and directly maps to the requirements and design specifications. Tasks are ordered by technical dependencies and follow a test-driven development approach.

**Implementation Approach**: Build the minimal viable document analysis system incrementally, testing each component as it's developed. Focus on core functionality first, then add error handling and polish.
