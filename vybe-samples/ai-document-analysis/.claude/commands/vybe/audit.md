# /vybe:audit - Quality Assurance & Fix Automation

Comprehensive project quality assurance focused on detecting gaps, duplicates, and inconsistencies with automated fix suggestions and consolidation tools.

## Core Purpose
**Find and fix problems, not show progress** (use `/vybe:status` for progress tracking)

## Usage
```bash
/vybe:audit [scope] [--fix] [--auto-fix] [--verify]

# Traditional gap detection:
/vybe:audit                          # Complete project audit
/vybe:audit features                 # Feature specification gaps
/vybe:audit tasks                    # Missing/duplicate tasks 
/vybe:audit dependencies             # Circular deps, conflicts
/vybe:audit consistency              # Terminology, standards
/vybe:audit members                  # Assignment conflicts, imbalance

# ðŸ”¥ NEW: Code-Reality Analysis Modes (Fixed, Predictable Output):
/vybe:audit code-reality             # Compare actual code vs documented plans
/vybe:audit scope-drift              # Detect feature creep beyond original vision
/vybe:audit business-value           # Find features not tied to business outcomes
/vybe:audit documentation            # Find README/docs out of sync with code
/vybe:audit mvp-extraction           # Suggest minimal viable scope for timeboxes

# Timeline-focused modes:
/vybe:audit mvp-extraction --timeline=14days    # Extract 2-week MVP
/vybe:audit mvp-extraction --timeline=30days    # Extract 1-month scope
/vybe:audit scope-drift --baseline=init         # Compare vs original init

# Fix automation:
/vybe:audit fix-gaps [scope]         # Add missing sections
/vybe:audit fix-duplicates [scope]   # Consolidate duplicates
/vybe:audit fix-consistency [scope]  # Resolve conflicts
/vybe:audit fix-dependencies         # Resolve circular deps
/vybe:audit --auto-fix safe          # Apply safe fixes automatically
```

## Audit vs Status Distinction

| `/vybe:status` | `/vybe:audit` |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Progress tracking** | **Quality assurance** |
| What's done/doing | What's wrong/missing |
| Progress bars, assignments | Gaps, conflicts, fixes |
| "How are we doing?" | "What needs fixing?" |

## Platform Compatibility
- [OK] Linux, macOS, WSL2, Git Bash
- [NO] Native Windows CMD/PowerShell

## Pre-Audit Checks

### Project Readiness
- Vybe initialized: `bash -c '[ -d ".vybe/project" ] && echo "[OK] Project ready" || echo "[NO] Run /vybe:init first"'`
- Features exist: `bash -c '[ -d ".vybe/features" ] && ls -d .vybe/features/*/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo "{} features to audit" || echo "0 features to audit"'`
- Members configured: `bash -c '[ -f ".vybe/backlog.md" ] && grep -q "^## Members:" .vybe/backlog.md && echo "[OK] Members configured" || echo "[INFO] Solo mode"'`

## CRITICAL: Complete Context Loading

### Task 0: Load ALL Project Context (MANDATORY)
```bash
echo "[CONTEXT] LOADING COMPLETE PROJECT CONTEXT"
echo "=============================="
echo ""

# Load foundation documents (MANDATORY)
if [ ! -f ".vybe/project/overview.md" ]; then
    echo "[NO] CRITICAL: overview.md missing"
    echo "Run /vybe:init to create project foundation"
    exit 1
fi

if [ ! -f ".vybe/project/architecture.md" ]; then
    echo "[NO] CRITICAL: architecture.md missing" 
    echo "Run /vybe:init to create project foundation"
    exit 1
fi

if [ ! -f ".vybe/project/conventions.md" ]; then
    echo "[NO] CRITICAL: conventions.md missing"
    echo "Run /vybe:init to create project foundation"
    exit 1
fi

echo "[OK] Loading project foundation..."
echo ""
echo "=== PROJECT OVERVIEW ==="
cat .vybe/project/overview.md
echo ""
echo "=== ARCHITECTURE CONSTRAINTS ==="  
cat .vybe/project/architecture.md
echo ""
echo "=== CODING STANDARDS ==="
cat .vybe/project/conventions.md
echo ""

# Load additional context
if [ -f ".vybe/backlog.md" ]; then
    echo "=== BACKLOG & MEMBERS ==="
    cat .vybe/backlog.md
    echo ""
fi

echo "[CONTEXT] Project context loaded - proceeding with audit"
echo "=============================="
echo ""
```

## Audit Execution

### Initialize Audit Variables
```bash
audit_scope="${1:-default}"
audit_fix_mode="${2:-none}"
issues_found=0
gaps_found=0
duplicates_found=0  
conflicts_found=0
fixes_available=0

# Create audit session
audit_timestamp=$(date '+%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
audit_dir=".vybe/audit"
mkdir -p "$audit_dir"
audit_report="$audit_dir/audit-$audit_timestamp.md"

echo "# Vybe Project Audit Report" > "$audit_report"
echo "**Date**: $(date)" >> "$audit_report"
echo "**Scope**: $audit_scope" >> "$audit_report"
echo "" >> "$audit_report"

## Documentation

### Purpose
The `/vybe:audit` command focuses exclusively on **quality assurance and fix automation**:

1. **Gap Detection** - Identifies missing sections, requirements, tasks
2. **Duplicate Consolidation** - Finds and merges duplicate content
3. **Consistency Resolution** - Resolves terminology and naming conflicts  
4. **Automated Fixes** - Provides specific commands to resolve issues
5. **Quality Certification** - Validates project readiness

### Differentiation from Status
- **Status**: Progress tracking, assignments, what's being worked on
- **Audit**: Quality issues, gaps, conflicts, what needs fixing

### Fix Automation Levels
1. **Safe Auto-fixes** (`--auto-fix safe`) - Terminology, naming, missing sections
2. **Interactive Fixes** (`--fix interactive`) - Dependency conflicts, scope decisions  
3. **Manual Guidance** (`--fix manual`) - Complex architectural changes

### Integration Points
- Works with `/vybe:plan` to improve specifications
- Suggests `/vybe:backlog` assignment changes
- Coordinates with `/vybe:status` for comprehensive project view
- Provides input for `/vybe:discuss` conversations

This audit command now serves its intended purpose as a quality assurance and fix automation tool, clearly distinct from the progress-tracking status command.
