# Project Planning Meeting Notes

## Meeting Details
Date: December 15, 2024
Attendees: Sarah Johnson (Project Manager), Mike Chen (Lead Developer), Lisa Rodriguez (Designer), Tom Wilson (QA Lead)

## Project Overview
We discussed the upcoming Document Analysis AI project, which aims to help knowledge workers process documents more efficiently using artificial intelligence. The system will allow users to upload documents and receive automated summaries.

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Technology Stack**: We decided to use FastAPI for the backend API, with Python as the primary programming language. The team agreed that this would provide the best balance of development speed and performance.

2. **AI Integration**: OpenAI's GPT-4 will be used for document summarization. This decision was made after evaluating several alternatives, considering both accuracy and cost factors.

3. **File Support**: Initially, the system will support PDF and plain text files. Additional formats like Word documents will be added in future phases.

4. **User Interface**: A simple web-based interface will be developed for the initial release. The design should be clean and intuitive, allowing users to drag and drop files for analysis.

## Timeline and Milestones
- **Phase 1** (Week 1-2): Basic infrastructure and file upload functionality
- **Phase 2** (Week 3-4): AI integration and text processing
- **Phase 3** (Week 5-6): User interface development and testing
- **Phase 4** (Week 7-8): Security enhancements and production deployment

## Risk Assessment
The main risks identified include:
- Potential delays in OpenAI API integration
- File processing challenges with various document formats
- User adoption and training requirements

## Action Items
1. Sarah to prepare detailed project requirements document by December 20
2. Mike to research and prototype the FastAPI backend architecture
3. Lisa to create UI mockups and user flow diagrams
4. Tom to define testing strategy and quality assurance processes

## Budget Considerations
Initial estimates suggest a total project cost of $75,000, including development time, API costs, and infrastructure. This will need approval from the finance team before proceeding.

## Next Steps
The next meeting is scheduled for December 22, 2024, where we will review progress on action items and finalize the project charter. All team members should come prepared with their respective deliverables.
