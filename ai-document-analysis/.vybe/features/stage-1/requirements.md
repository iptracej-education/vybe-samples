# Requirements Document - Stage 1: Basic Document Analysis

## Introduction
Stage 1 establishes the foundational document analysis capability for the Document Analysis AI App. This stage enables users to upload individual documents (text files and PDFs) and receive AI-generated summaries through a simple web interface. Built on the GenAI Launchpad framework using FastAPI and OpenAI integration, this stage provides the core value proposition of automated document analysis while maintaining focus on simplicity and rapid delivery.

**Business Value**: Knowledge workers, legal professionals, and business analysts can immediately begin using AI to reduce manual document review time by 90%, enabling faster research, report generation, and analysis workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Upload and Processing

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user accesses the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a clean upload form with drag-and-drop capability
2. WHEN a user selects a TXT file (≤10MB) THEN the system SHALL accept the file and validate encoding (UTF-8, ASCII)
3. WHEN a user selects a PDF file (≤10MB) THEN the system SHALL accept the file and validate it is a readable PDF format
4. IF a user uploads an unsupported file type THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message listing supported formats
5. IF a user uploads a file exceeding 10MB THEN the system SHALL reject the file with size limit guidance
6. WHEN a valid file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display upload progress and confirmation
7. WHERE file processing encounters an error THE system SHALL provide specific feedback about the issue

### Requirement 2: Text Extraction and Content Preparation
**User Story:** As a system user, I want reliable text extraction from my documents, so that the AI analysis receives clean, processable content.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a TXT file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract full text content preserving line breaks and structure
2. WHEN a PDF file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL extract text using pdfplumber library for optimal layout preservation
3. IF text extraction fails from a PDF THEN the system SHALL provide fallback error message suggesting file may be corrupted or image-based
4. WHEN text is extracted THEN the system SHALL validate content is not empty (minimum 50 characters)
5. WHILE processing extraction THE system SHALL handle encoding issues gracefully and attempt UTF-8 conversion
6. WHERE extracted text exceeds token limits THE system SHALL intelligently truncate while preserving key sections

### Requirement 3: AI-Powered Document Summarization
**User Story:** As a professional analyzing documents, I want AI-generated summaries of my documents, so that I can quickly understand key content without reading entire documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN document text is successfully extracted THEN the system SHALL send content to OpenAI API for summarization
2. WHEN calling OpenAI API THEN the system SHALL use GPT-4 model with appropriate prompt template for document summarization
3. IF OpenAI API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display clear error message with retry option
4. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff retry strategy
5. WHEN summary is generated THEN the system SHALL validate response contains meaningful content (minimum 100 characters)
6. WHILE API processing occurs THE system SHALL display progress indicator to user
7. WHERE API calls fail THE system SHALL log errors and provide user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 4: Results Display and User Experience
**User Story:** As a document analyzer, I want clear presentation of analysis results, so that I can quickly review and act on the generated insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN AI summary is generated THEN the system SHALL display results in a clean, readable format
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show original filename, file size, and processing timestamp
3. WHEN results are shown THEN the system SHALL provide option to download summary as text file
4. IF processing takes longer than 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators with estimated time
5. WHEN processing completes successfully THEN the system SHALL confirm completion within 30 seconds target time
6. WHERE results are displayed THE system SHALL provide clear navigation to upload another document
7. WHILE user reviews results THE system SHALL maintain responsive interface performance

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and System Reliability
**User Story:** As a system user, I want clear feedback when errors occur, so that I understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN any system error occurs THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with specific guidance
2. IF file upload fails THEN the system SHALL provide retry option and troubleshooting suggestions
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL distinguish between temporary issues and configuration problems
4. IF OpenAI API key is invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear configuration error message
5. WHEN system encounters unexpected errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging
6. WHILE maintaining error logs THE system SHALL not expose sensitive information to users
7. WHERE errors prevent processing THE system SHALL provide alternative actions or contact information

### Requirement 6: Security and Data Protection
**User Story:** As a professional handling sensitive documents, I want assurance that my data is handled securely, so that I can trust the system with confidential information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL validate file content is not malicious
2. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL not persist document content longer than processing session
3. IF suspicious file patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL reject upload with security warning
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use secure HTTPS connections only
5. WHEN session ends THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary files and clear memory
6. WHILE handling user data THE system SHALL not log document content or personal information
7. WHERE document processing occurs THE system SHALL operate within secure application boundaries

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability Foundation
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable performance characteristics, so that the system can handle expected usage patterns effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN processing standard documents (1-5 pages) THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 30 seconds
2. WHEN multiple users access simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive performance for up to 10 concurrent users
3. IF system load increases THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle requests without crashes
4. WHEN running in Docker environment THEN the system SHALL start successfully and respond to health checks
5. WHILE processing documents THE system SHALL use memory efficiently and release resources promptly
6. WHERE processing times exceed targets THE system SHALL provide transparent feedback to users
