# /vybe:release - Outcome Stage Progression

Mark current outcome stage as complete and advance to the next stage in your incremental development roadmap.

## Usage
```bash
/vybe:release [stage-name] [--force]
```

## Parameters
- `stage-name`: Optional. Specific stage to mark complete (defaults to current active stage)
- `--force`: Skip validation checks and force stage completion

## Pre-Release Validation

### Current Stage Status
- Outcome roadmap: `bash -c '[ -f ".vybe/project/outcomes.md" ] && echo "[OK] Outcome roadmap found" || echo "[NO] Run /vybe:init first"'`
- Active stage: `bash -c '[ -f ".vybe/backlog.md" ] && grep "Active Stage:" .vybe/backlog.md | head -1 || echo "No active stage"'`
- Tasks remaining: `bash -c '[ -f ".vybe/backlog.md" ] && grep -A 20 "IN PROGRESS" .vybe/backlog.md | grep "^\- \[ \]" | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo "{} tasks incomplete" || echo "Unknown"'`
- Tests passing: `bash -c 'npm test 2>/dev/null && echo "[OK] Tests passing" || echo "[WARN] Tests not verified"'`

## CRITICAL: Mandatory Context Loading

### Task 0: Load Complete Project Context

        echo "[STOP] Cannot release with incomplete tasks"
        echo "   Complete all tasks or use --force to override"
        exit 1
    else
        echo "[FORCE] Overriding incomplete tasks check"

## Task 2: Capture Stage Learnings

### Document What We Learned
```bash

## Task 3: Mark Stage Complete

### Update Status in Documents

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
- **Incomplete tasks**: Use --force to override or complete remaining tasks
- **No tests**: Proceed with manual verification
- **Missing outcomes.md**: Run /vybe:init to set up staged outcomes
- **No next stage**: Define additional stages in outcomes.md

### Recovery Actions
- **Rollback**: Revert status changes if release fails
- **Manual override**: Use --force flag when appropriate
- **Stage adjustment**: Modify outcomes.md to add/remove stages
- **Task migration**: Move incomplete tasks to next stage if needed
