# /vybe:discuss - Natural Language Assistant with Smart Audit Routing

Transform natural language requests into specific Vybe command sequences with intelligent routing to specialized audit analysis modes. Describe what you want to accomplish in plain English, and get both command sequences AND automated code-reality analysis.

## Usage
```bash
/vybe:discuss "[your request in natural language]"
```

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Command Translation
```bash
/vybe:discuss "We need to add mobile support to our web app"
/vybe:discuss "Switch from REST to GraphQL for better performance"  
/vybe:discuss "Add analytics dashboard and email notifications"
/vybe:discuss "We're behind schedule, need to redistribute work"
```

### 2. Code-Reality Analysis (ðŸ”¥ POWERFUL)
```bash
# Project reshaping and scope analysis
/vybe:discuss "reshape this project to fit 2 weeks, prefer MVP, keep security, limit WIP to 2"
/vybe:discuss "analyze if we can ship this in 1 month with current team"
/vybe:discuss "what features can we cut to hit our deadline?"

# Documentation synchronization
/vybe:discuss "read discussion.md and add requirements to README.md, then adjust project scope"
/vybe:discuss "our README.md is outdated, sync it with actual implemented features"
/vybe:discuss "compare what we promise in docs vs what code actually does"

# Business outcome alignment
/vybe:discuss "find features not tied to business outcomes and suggest what to do"
/vybe:discuss "which implemented features don't match our original vision?"
/vybe:discuss "audit if our code supports the user stories in README.md"
```

### 3. Scope & Architecture Evolution
```bash
/vybe:discuss "analyze current code and suggest how to split into microservices"
/vybe:discuss "we added too many features, help us extract MVP"
/vybe:discuss "recommend what to refactor before adding [new feature]"
/vybe:discuss "evaluate if current architecture can handle 10x user growth"
```

### 4. Project Health Analysis
```bash
/vybe:discuss "find inconsistencies between backlog, README, and actual code"
/vybe:discuss "detect scope creep - what did we build beyond original plan?"
/vybe:discuss "which features have no tests and pose biggest risk?"
/vybe:discuss "analyze technical debt and suggest prioritization"
```

## How It Works

### Standard Command Translation
1. **Load complete project context** - Understanding current state
2. **Parse your natural language request** - What you want to accomplish
3. **Generate specific Vybe command sequence** - Step-by-step instructions
4. **Provide context and explanations** - Why each command is needed

### Code-Reality Analysis Process
1. **Multi-source analysis** - Read Vybe docs + actual source code + README/docs
2. **Gap detection** - Compare documented intentions vs implemented reality
3. **Business alignment check** - Verify features serve documented business outcomes
4. **Scope analysis** - Detect feature creep, missing features, orphaned code
5. **Actionable recommendations** - Specific fixes, updates, and scope adjustments

## Platform Compatibility
- [OK] Linux, macOS, WSL2, Git Bash
- [NO] Native Windows CMD/PowerShell

## Pre-Discussion Checks

### Project Status
- Vybe initialized: `bash -c '[ -d ".vybe/project" ] && echo "[OK] Project ready" || echo "[NO] Run /vybe:init first"'`
- Project context: `bash -c 'ls .vybe/project/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo "{} project documents available"'`
- Members configured: `bash -c '[ -f ".vybe/backlog.md" ] && grep -q "^## Members:" .vybe/backlog.md && echo "[OK] Members configured" || echo "[INFO] No members configured"'`

### Current State
- Features planned: `bash -c '[ -d ".vybe/features" ] && ls -d .vybe/features/*/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l | xargs -I {} echo "{} features planned" || echo "0 features planned"'`
- Backlog items: `bash -c '[ -f ".vybe/backlog.md" ] && grep -c "^- \[" .vybe/backlog.md || echo "0"'`

## Advanced Examples: Code-Reality Analysis

### 1. Project Scope Adjustment with Smart Routing
```bash
/vybe:discuss "reshape this project to fit 2 weeks, prefer MVP, keep security, limit WIP to 2"

# Smart Routing Output:
[DETECTED] Analysis request - routing to specialized audit commands
[ROUTING] Determining required audit modes...
  â†’ MVP extraction analysis needed
  â†’ Scope drift analysis needed

[COMMANDS] Will execute the following audit commands:
  /vybe:audit mvp-extraction --timeline=14days
  /vybe:audit scope-drift

[AI] EXECUTE AUDIT COMMANDS NOW:
# AI then runs the specific audit commands and provides structured results
# Based on YOUR actual project analysis, not hardcoded examples

[FOLLOW-UP] Recommended next steps:
1. Review audit results above
2. /vybe:backlog groom --mvp-focus  
3. Update outcomes.md with revised stages
4. /vybe:status outcomes - track progress
```

### 2. Documentation Synchronization with Smart Routing
```bash
/vybe:discuss "our README.md is outdated, sync it with actual implemented features"

# Smart Routing Output:
[DETECTED] Analysis request - routing to specialized audit commands
[ROUTING] Determining required audit modes...
  â†’ Documentation sync analysis needed
  â†’ General code-reality analysis needed

[COMMANDS] Will execute the following audit commands:
  /vybe:audit documentation
  /vybe:audit code-reality

[AI] EXECUTE AUDIT COMMANDS NOW:
# AI runs specialized audit commands on YOUR actual files
# Compares YOUR README.md with YOUR source code
# No hardcoded assumptions about your tech stack

[FOLLOW-UP] Based on audit results:
1. Update documentation files as recommended
2. /vybe:audit --verify - confirm fixes work
3. /vybe:status - check overall project health
```

### 3. Business Outcome Alignment with Smart Routing
```bash
/vybe:discuss "find features not tied to business outcomes and suggest what to do"

# Smart Routing Output:
[DETECTED] Analysis request - routing to specialized audit commands
[ROUTING] Determining required audit modes...
  â†’ Business value analysis needed

[COMMANDS] Will execute the following audit commands:
  /vybe:audit business-value

[AI] EXECUTE AUDIT COMMANDS NOW:
# AI analyzes YOUR actual source code features
# Maps against YOUR outcomes.md business values  
# Identifies YOUR specific orphan features with real LOC counts
# Based on YOUR project, not generic examples

[FOLLOW-UP] Recommended actions:
1. Review business value audit results
2. Update outcomes.md to justify orphan features OR remove them
3. /vybe:plan [missing-features] for unimplemented outcomes
4. /vybe:status outcomes - track business alignment
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Cases
```bash
# No project context
if [ "$project_loaded" = false ]; then
    echo "[NO] CRITICAL: No project context found"
    echo "   Run: /vybe:init first"
    exit 1
fi

# Empty request
if [ -z "$request" ]; then
    echo "[NO] ERROR: Request required"
    echo "   Describe what you want to accomplish"
    echo "   Example: /vybe:discuss \"add mobile support\""
    exit 1
fi

# Too vague request
if echo "$request" | grep -qi "^help$\|^what\|^how$"; then
    echo "[CLARIFY] Request too general"
    echo "   Try being more specific:"
    echo "   Instead of: 'help'"
    echo "   Try: 'add user authentication feature'"
    echo "   Or: 'switch database from MySQL to PostgreSQL'"
    exit 1
fi
```

## AI Implementation Guidelines

### Natural Language Understanding
1. **Parse intent** - What does the user actually want to accomplish?
2. **Understand context** - What's the current project state?
3. **Map to commands** - Which Vybe commands achieve this goal?
4. **Provide sequence** - Step-by-step command workflow
5. **Add context** - Explain why each command is needed

### Response Quality Standards
- **Specific commands** - Always provide exact Vybe commands to run
- **Contextual awareness** - Consider current project state
- **Explain rationale** - Why each command is recommended
- **Warn of risks** - Highlight potential issues or dependencies
- **Provide alternatives** - Suggest different approaches when applicable

### Command Generation Rules
- **Load full context** - Always understand complete project state first
- **Specific over generic** - Provide exact commands, not just categories
- **Sequential workflow** - Commands in logical execution order
- **Member awareness** - Consider member count and assignments
- **Quality focus** - Include audit/validation steps for major changes

This `/vybe:discuss` command transforms natural language requests into actionable Vybe command sequences, making the framework much more accessible to users who want to describe what they need rather than remember specific command syntax.
